Often when working with UVs for a 3D model, you need to see how the texture lays down, and the more complex the shape of the figure, the more difficult it is sometimes to apply the texture correctly. For such purposes, there are special textures for evaluating UV coordinates and the correct placement of textures. This texture for checking UV, was originally made for personal purposes and in a short period, it has come in handy more than once and proved its effectiveness and convenience, with which I share with you.

The texture has a resolution of 6400px by 6400px and an aspect ratio of 1 to 1. Each cell has its own alphanumeric designation, for the convenience of finding the affected coordinates. For example, the first cell in the first row is A 1, and the last is Tt 20. To make it easier to find affected cells, a gradient fill is used to make it easier to find the cells you need. The white grid allows you to clearly see the bends and transitions. To determine the direction, each of the corners of the cells are marked with special symbols to make it easier to navigate relative to the XYZ coordinates.

### Visually, it looks something like in the images below:
